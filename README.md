# iSongs App

The application consists of two screens in a tab bar container:
1. Screen for searching tracks by keywords. The table displays all found compositions. When you click on a cell, a screen opens where you can listen to a preview of the track.
2. Playback history screen. It is possible to delete tracks from history.

## What I used:

- Architecture - Clean Swift (VIP)
- User interface - UIKit code layout
